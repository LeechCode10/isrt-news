    <h1>Tension arises as Freshman Female Student called 'Bhai' instead of 'Bhaiyaaaa' to a Final Year Student</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        The Senior-Junior bonding is at stake since last week (on Friday), one of the stunning freshman female students called out a final year student as 'Bhai'
        instead of the usual 'Bhaiyaaaa'. This devastated the senior student and he was seen crying in the ISRT canteen, while his friends were trying to console him.
        The incident has sparked a heated debate among the students, with many expressing their concerns about the changing dynamics of the department culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        As many of the students still aren't aware what is the necessity of this so called restriction of male students being limited to 'Bhai' and female students must call 'Bhaiya'.
        Some believe this will help maintain a respectful environment and prepare students for the real world culture where as they are already stuck in the loop of biostats, ICDDR,B and 
        BDB AD. However, nobody raised a question aagainst this vague cultural exploit. Some of the most bonding enthusiasts of the department suggest this will help students writing a 
        proper research paper; don't even know who tf even wrote this rule, but it is there in the ISRT constitution.

        Whatever, back to the incident, the final year student was seen wearing a 'Bhaiya' t-shirt and a 'Bhaiya' cap the next day, which he bought from the ISRT canteen. He was also seen carrying a 'Bhaiya' bag, which he claimed was a gift from his friends. 
        This made the freshman student not only disgusted but awfully uncomfortable, she couldn't even look at him in the eye. The final year student was seen trying to explain the importance of the 'Bhaiya' culture to the freshman student, but she was not interested in listening. 
        Failing to convince her, he got his ego hurt and called upon a meeting from the n-th batch to (n-4)-th batch, constantly bullying the CR as if it was his fault that he couldn't get everyone used to this absurd and meaningless code of conduct.
        The unemployed final year students are in grave concern about the future of their bonding with the first years. They threatened to cut off all ties with the juniors if this issue is not addressed.
        Later that day, first year students were forced into saying sorry as a batch to the final year students.
    </p>


    <p>
        This afternoon one of the first years was eavesdropped saying, "The Final Year Students surpassed even the Diddy." Thanks to god the creepy males from that batch didn't know the meaning of 'Diddy' and it
        left them in confusion. However, they took that as a compliment. Forcing newcomer girls to say 'Bhaiya' is now a creepy tradition which has been normalized in ISRT. And it also gave room for the seniors to bully the male juniors when they mistakenly call them 'Bhaiya' instead of 'Bhai'.
        This should not be stopped. They should add up more rules like this to enhance research quality and maintain a studious environment in the department.

        Their parents will be so proud when the see their children being serious about things that don't matter and make them feel victorious when they will know their son and daughter has the only purpose in life is to bully the juniors and torture mentally in the name of better bonding and culture.
