    <h1>Authority pays $400 to a developer for a 'auto-sorting' CGPA calculator application</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        This isn't even funny anymore and I'm tired of writing these articles. The ISRT authority has paid a whopping $400 to a local developer from Chankharpool to 
        develop a CGPA calculator application that automatically sorts the CGPA of students. Since the authority is too deppreciative of 'Applied' sides of any field, acknowledging their 
        own students incompetent of such simple task, they have decided to outsource this job to a local developer. Alas! years of writing codes in #C, R and Python and developing 
        the CGPA calculator algorithm over and over each year, all for nothing. The senior faculty members of ISRT claim that it can eat 10 Facebooks and 5 Amazons and still be hungry for more.
        ChatGPT it's coming and you are next!

        My personal opinion, I know it won't matter, is that they could hire a better CS lecturer for proper classroom teaching, or the least they could do is improve the internet 
        connection speed with the money they spent on this. I mean that rusty connection speed is slower than my grandmother's heartbeat. However, interesting fact is- even the CEO of
        deepseek rewarded his developer with $3000 for developing a better AI than ChatGPT, but our honorable faculty board is so generous that they paid $400 to just nothing with the money
        that they begged from DU central. What a waste!!! Guess what did the DU central paid us back with? Bang!!! Final exams at curzon hall. A Dhabians dream!!! One more wishlist checked!
        The exam halls are so high and mighty that even the ceiling fans are begging for mercy. Let's not even talk about the belonging thefts. Some say our honorable _____ are directly
        involved in this, which I actually do not believe, but their incorporations with the students and callous to bring justice and enroll a proper investigation is quite suspicious.
        The most student friendly department of the country man!!

        Back to the topic, so these expert formula derivers think it's a automated CGPA calculator or predictor that will atutomatically sort CGPAs and thus it will easily find 
        another potential faculty. Little do they know it's literally a 4 lines of code that can be written in any programming language. The code is so simple that even a 5th grader can write it.
        The code is so simple that even a 5th grader can write it. Those who are interested in stepping into the world of programming and data science, please avoid ISRT. The highest
        you will do here is writing CGPA calculator in 3 different languages with 2.3 CGPA in your pocket. If you actually needed a code for sorting and finding your worst lecturers,
        you could have just asked me instead :(( <br>
        Whatever here is a sample code in Python that does exactly what the authority is paying $400 for.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            import pandas as pd

            df = pd.read_csv('cgpa_data.csv') 

            sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='CGPA', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True) 
 

            sorted_df.to_csv('sorted_cgpa.csv', index=False)  
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Let me know if you need anything for free or the same code in R and #C as well. I will be happy to help you out.

        Long story short, it is a matter of disgeace that these old hags are determined to handpick the worst of their beings by only measuring their CGPA and not their actual tutoring
        skills. Instead of creating professionals they decided to uphold their curriculum designed for public health which will benefit in research and PhD as if it's a pure mathematics
        major and they have only chances in the medical fields. LOL <br>
        Hats off to these mfs who can't even update the syllabus and can't stop pretending that changing the name is enough to outreach the institutions fame. Let's be real for once and 
        actually be real, what could be the proper reason for gatekeeping the students from learning the actual skills that they can apply in the professional fields?
