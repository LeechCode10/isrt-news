    <h1>ISRT changes its name to FF</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        FF, it doesn't mean Final Fantasy, not Forfeited Funds, not Free Fire, not even Factory of Fools. It means <a href="" class="underlined">Faculty Factory</a>. Finally a suitable name for the Institute.
        Even the critics are impressed by the name change. They've stopped scamming in the name of 'Applied' and 'Data Science' once and for all, however the major is still the same.
        Finally a name that suits their purpose and goals. It's the only move that makes sense in the history of ISRT. Students are impressed at faculties and thanking them for not even trying to hide it anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
Students came here with dreams and aspirations of becoming data scientists, but they were met with a harsh reality. The curriculum is outdated, the teaching methods are archaic, and faculty members treat students poorly.

And let‚Äôs not even start on the courses. I once saw a classmate‚Äôs LinkedIn bio that read: ‚ÄúMLOps and Blockchain enthusiast.‚Äù In reality, the only ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù he experienced here was the chain of blockades set up by seniors who love imprisoning juniors during recess. His LinkedIn profile was later renamed to Tun Tun Sahoor.

The amount of trauma and stress an average ISRT student endures is unimaginable. Their potential is slowly crushed, not because they lack talent, but because the faculty members simply don‚Äôt care. They make no real effort to teach properly. Ironically, they seem to reserve their actual dedication for private university students‚Äîbecause those students pay them well.    </p>

    <p>
        They created a curriculum 20 years ago‚Äîback when Facebook was just a college project. And they‚Äôre still copy-pasting the same outdated content over and over again.

Not everyone is pursuing academia or a PhD as a career. You need to teach things that are actually useful in the industry.

While top universities around the world are developing AI models, making history, building robots with AI, and pushing the boundaries of innovation‚Äîyou‚Äôre out here making students write 13-page-long proofs that you yourself never looked at twice after graduating. You're whiteboarding everything straight from the same old notebook you either collected or copied from another teacher back in your day.

Bro, do better.
    </p>
        <div class="ad-container">
    <div class="ad8"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
       You think teachers' evaluations are taken seriously? Are you out of your mind? They don't even open them‚Äîlmao. It's the only functional feature ISRT is forced to implement because central DU made it mandatory.

Otherwise, your negative review has zero effect on the shameless individuals we call teachers. They're some of the most self-entitled people out there, completely indifferent to any feedback about how they could improve.

In fact, some of them return in their worst possible form after receiving a negative review. They‚Äôve never been second to anyone in their entire lives, so how dare a mere student with a CGPA of 3.85 attempt to evaluate them, right?

They have job security, so they don‚Äôt care about losing their positions. That allows them to impose whatever they want and manipulate the entire system. Nothing changes. There‚Äôs no reconstruction of the curriculum.

So escape this trap-hole as soon as you can‚Äîunless you plan to become a faculty member. And if you do, please stay humble, be considerate of students, and at least try to respond to what this industrial era demands.
