    <h1>Master's Student Bursts into tears as homeless guy asks, 'What is the color of your thesis?'</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Racism didn't peak when Black people were enslaved. It peaked when a homeless beggar asked an ISRT 5th-year student if he was 'thesis or not.' The community was already bashing the guy for not holding a place in the top 15, but that wasn't enough. It had to be this way, where a homeless person with Down syndrome mocked him for his 10 Taka donation, which led to immediate humiliation.

        As for the "weather demand", the student has been spotted enriching his newly created LinkedIn profile for the past two months with unnecessary skills. Skills such as machine learning, even though he doesn't even know what XGBoost does, and for him, "random forest" just means the Amazon or Sub-Sahara. He was also seen flexing his culinary skills, as if he'd consider maid jobs if he ever needed to. When one of the junior faculty members (using fake account), stalking his account with a fake profile, got genuinely annoyed, it was because "my guy" didn't even list "formula derivation" as a skill!

        He attempted to give money to the beggar while on his 9th tuition class in Kathalbagan today. He approached the man and gave him 10 Taka,
        praying this would end his suffering as an ISRTian. But alas, little did he know that 10 Taka was way below standard for this beggar,
        as inflation is shouting loud everywhere. Whatever, only a starting salary of 40,000 Taka at ICDDR,B could 
        heal him from this agony. That is, until the beggar decided to throw that 10 Taka back at him and used local slangs that even the Bengali dictionary couldn't update yet.

        After all that demotivation, my brother decided to give up on his major and focus on BCS preparation. He was looking up to the "Boro Bhais" who kept saying, "BCS is the solution, and BDB AD is the backup plan." On his way back home, he bought two latest versions of MP3, all while cursing the beggar for not knowing the derivations of Bayesian Statistics.
